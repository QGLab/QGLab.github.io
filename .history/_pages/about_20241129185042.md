I’m **Qiang Gao <font face="楷体" >(高强)</font>**, a master student (expected to graduate in 2025) of **Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**. Before that, I received the B.E. degree from Zhengzhou University (ZZU) in 2022. My research interests are in computer vision, with a particular focus on **3D Object Detection** and **Outdoor Scene Reconstruction**, especially in the context of **degraded mining environments**.

I am open for collaborations in research. I am also actively looking for collaborators. Please feel free to contact me!
